# Lighthouse

The project is a graphics-based application that creates a visual scene with a lighthouse, island, water, boats, and a moon. Key features include:

Constructing the 3D scene elements (water, island, lighthouse, boats, moon)
Texturing the scene objects
Implementing water movement and wave effects using shaders
Lighting the scene with point, directional, and spotlight sources
Creating an interactive UI with sliders to control the lighthouse light colors
Animating the boats to move around the island

The project specifications provide detailed requirements for each of these components. It is implemented using C++ and OpenGL, with the final application expected to be submitted and presented in a laboratory setting.
